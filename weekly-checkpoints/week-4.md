## Week 4

Date: 04/25/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week [yes/no]
* I know what to do next week [yes/no]
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing [yes/no]
* I'm enjoying the program so far [yes/no]

## Status Update

Please mention the work you did this week. A good status update will mention the things you learned, the things you tried (both what worked and what didn't); and the things you did. As an example:

> I filed an issue [Feature request: Add ability to change default language](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/586) based on the discussion in the Discord. I reproduced the issue using [reasonml/reasonml.github.io](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io), which has a lot of existing translations. This may be a good issue for me to work on in the future.

## Plan

Summarize what you plan on learning or working on in the next week, and if there are any concerns you have about the plan. As an example:

> I plan on investigating if approach X will help me with Issue Y (link here). I'm concerned about [some concern here].
