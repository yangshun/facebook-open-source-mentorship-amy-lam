## Week 4

Date: 04/25/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - no, this was an unproductive week.
* I know what to do next week - yes.
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - yes/no, left some questions / WIP PRs here, to help in moving forward tomorrow.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes.

## Status Update

* I filed an issue [Feature request: Add ability to change default language](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/586) based on the discussion in the Discord. I reproduced the issue using [reasonml/reasonml.github.io](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io), which has a lot of existing translations. This may be a good issue for me to work on in the future.
* I started to work on the [copy feature](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/500) today. Here is my [WIP PR](https://github.com/amyrlam/Docusaurus/pull/1), just made it on my fork since very undone. I'm not sure if I'm way off here?
* I started to work on the [LiveReload feature](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/234) today. Here is my [WIP PR](https://github.com/amyrlam/Docusaurus/pull/2). Is this on the right track or completely off?

## Plan

* Just focus on copy and LiveReload this week.
* Get other stuff done if extra time.
* Carve out time in the mornings before work.
