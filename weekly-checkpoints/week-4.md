## Week 4

Date: 05/03/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - no, this was an unproductive week.
* I know what to do next week - yes.
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - yes/no, left some questions / WIP PRs here, to help in moving forward tomorrow.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes.

## Status Update

* I filed an issue [Feature request: Add ability to change default language](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/586) based on the discussion in the Discord. I reproduced the issue using [reasonml/reasonml.github.io](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io), which has a lot of existing translations. This may be a good issue for me to work on in the future.
* Posted [Update deprecated GitHub Buttons data-count-api](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/616), noticed while working on the copy feature.

* I started to work on the [copy feature](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/500). Here was my first [WIP PR](https://github.com/amyrlam/Docusaurus/pull/1). Attempted again in a second [WIP PR](https://github.com/amyrlam/Docusaurus/pull/3) which literally ports over the functionality from babeljs/website.
  * Some of this code is unneeded so need to clean it up.
  * Fix the copy button styling to match the icon on https://clipboardjs.com/.

* I started to work on the [LiveReload feature](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/234). Here is my [WIP PR](https://github.com/amyrlam/Docusaurus/pull/2). Added a gif which shows LiveReload working on a hard refresh, but not on file save. At the least, it's a lot easier to develop versus restarting `yarn start` every time.

## Plan

* Just focus on copy and LiveReload this week.
* Get other stuff done if extra time.
* Carve out time in the mornings before work.
