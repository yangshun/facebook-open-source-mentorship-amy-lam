## Week 6

Date: 05/17/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - yes.
* I know what to do next week - This is the last week of the program, but yes. I plan to keep working on Docusaurus! I think that [Reload siteConfig.js automatically when locally served page is refreshed](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/267) may be a good next task. Noted more about this below if we have time.
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - no.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes! I had an amazing experience in the program. It was great working with Yangshun and Joel. Yangshun - thank you for being so helpful and flexible. I appreciate you mentoring me! ðŸŽ‰

## Status Update

* Got [Print out directory tree using docusaurus-init](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/665) merged, thanks for chiming in on the PR. Followed your commits afterward to understand it and finally see the tree outputted on my own.
* Got [Add LiveReload](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/663) merged!
* [Add copy functionality to code blocks in Docusaurus itself](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/634) is in review, let me know if any changes needed.

## Plan

* Wrap up copy story. Choose next issue.
  * Any ideas on how to get started on [Reload siteConfig.js automatically when locally served page is refreshed](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/267) if seems like a good issue for me to work on? I'm taking a look at `start-server.js` and `server.js` to learn more about what happens on a `npm run start`. (Or can choose another issue.)
* Follow PR's from Docusaurus from others to keep improving as a contributor and learning more about the app! ðŸ“ˆ
