## Week 3

Date: 04/18/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - yes and no, would like to get more done on a daily basis in Week 4, as opposed to skipping a few days like this week.
* I know what to do next week - yes, but want to discuss some tasks, mentioned in the Plan section.
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - no.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes, thanks to you and Joel for being so friendly and helpful!

Aside: Are you going to the F8 Conference? I may go just the second day, May 2, if you want to meet in person. No problem if not!

## Status Update

Please mention the work you did this week. A good status update will mention the things you learned, the things you tried (both what worked and what didn't); and the things you did. As an example:

* I worked on the default language issue from Discord. I tried to reproduce it in my own docusaurus-starter-kit, but didn't have all of the Crowdin translations set up. So, I then went about reproducing from [the user's repo](https://github.com/TheBestOrNothing/www.majorityattack.com). It was very confusing because the user's repo is a fork of Docusaurus instead of adding `docusaurus-init` via yarn/npm. I @'d the user in Discord for more info and will see if he responds. Yangshun also @'d the user to suggest that he not set up his repo as a fork of Docusaurus.
* I worked on [Add table to clarify versioning documentation](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/573), which closed [Update docs to clarify latest and current versioning](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/433).
* I worked on [Allow customizing of blog author image URL](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/577), which is an issue that we discussed at the Week 2 meeting. It turns out this functionality existed, but I updated the documentation to make it clearer.
  * That also resulted in [Replace authorImage with authorImageURL PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/314) on react-native-website.
  * Filed [Issue: Fix author images in blog](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/316) - wanted to discuss super quickly with you.
  * Remove authorImage from Docusaurus in future.
* I updated this plan as I went along this week, made it a lot easier. And the [Task Tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVCN7IUgQEo-tSkKP0-P6LtCW25Olnqj7KT-faUYRFI/edit#gid=0) is a good way to organize all the tasks.

## Plan

Summarize what you plan on learning or working on in the next week, and if there are any concerns you have about the plan. As an example:

* I'm starting to work on [Any plan to support copy the example code?](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/500) now. Meant to get it done in Week 3 but ran out of time.
* I'm starting to work on [Fix documentation for Unit 2, Parse stuf](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=162143457744403) to improve the open source mentorship program for the next person.
* I think that the live reload project would be a good project for the second half of the mentorship program since it will have a lot of impact and make it easier to develop in Docusaurus in the future.
* Let's discuss the stories below the grey line of the [Task Tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVCN7IUgQEo-tSkKP0-P6LtCW25Olnqj7KT-faUYRFI/edit#gid=0).
