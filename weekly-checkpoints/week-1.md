## Week 1

Date: 04/03/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - yes/no, mostly introductory work, but pretty good since was feeling sick Fri-Tue.
* I know what to do next week - no, but we can discuss this at the meeting!
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - no, just want to discuss what issue to take on first at the meeting.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes!

## Status Update

Please mention the work you did this week. A good status update will mention the things you learned, the things you tried (both what worked and what didn't); and the things you did. As an example:

- [x] [Unit 1 - Basics: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=662333824156547) This unit was pretty straightfoward. 👍
- [x] [Unit 2 - Project: F8 App](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=162143457744403) I followed the instructions but it seems like this unit should be N/A for the program now that Parse is no longer a thing? Can't log in at the Parse Dashboard http://localhost:4040/apps/F8/.
- [x] [Unit 3 - Project: Docusaurus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=916381401865001) Ran into some weirdness, which I noted [here](https://github.com/amyrlam/docusaurus-starter-kit/commit/ef86fdca64ff6fa6e9f4d67f25e6bdf00c03c2df). It didn't seem to matter too much, since it seemed like it would be a lot easier to test Docusaurus through Prettier or another open source repo with more content in there.
- Joined the Docusaurus Discord.
- Went through https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues.

## Plan

Summarize what you plan on learning or working on in the next week, and if there are any concerns you have about the plan. As an example:

Hope to discuss these at today's meeting for clarification on how to move forward!

> Want to check that https://github.com/prettier/prettier would be a good candidate for a real Docusaurus site?

Yangshun: Prettier is currently already using Docusaurus 😄

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/227 Always seems good to start with a bug fix to get accustomed to the repo. Maybe this one? Renaming versions doesn't change version in the sidebar.

Yangshun: It's a good starting point!

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/263 Add tests seems like an important issue to work on.

Yangshun: There seems to be a lot of work to be done here. That said, writing tests require good understanding of the code base, existing features and can get quite dry to work on after a while. Bug fixes would be preferred for quicker gratification and feedback.

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/356 Improve <table> styling.

Yangshun: This task allows you to exercise your creativity! Pretty cool. Note that because it's open-ended, it might take longer for reviews. For such tasks, it's better to come up with a mockup/prototype UI of the design and get signing off from the project maintainers before writing code for it.

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/500 New feature to copy code blocks.  For example, copying code blocks here https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html.

Yangshun: Good task that will benefit most (all?) users of Docusaurus.

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/234 New feature to add live reload. No idea how to do this yet, but implementing live reload would be cool. Would https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/267 be solved if live reload was added?

Yangshun: This makes for a good non-trivial project to work on from Week 3-5.

> PR open for 23 days? Will I get review from you and/or the Docusaurus team?
https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/495

Yangshun: Since I'm not from the Docusaurus team, I'm unable to give the final approval and merging of the PRs, but I can review the PR to the best of my ability.

> Calendar daily time for FB program to make more iterative progress in Week 2.

Yangshun: Sounds good!

## Meeting Notes

* No blockers and difficulties faced while doing the training units, except that the F8 app task had some compilation errors. Training units were helpful.
* No reviews for the PRs made against the [fbmentorship repository](https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/fbmentorship). Yangshun: I will ping the OSS team and ask them about it.
* Docusaurus as a project to work on for the program.\
  * It's a highly impactful project because many Facebook Open Source projects use it for documentation.
  * Many feature issues to work on since it is still a relatively new project.
  * Amy is pretty set on working on it!
* Set up a [task tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lVCN7IUgQEo-tSkKP0-P6LtCW25Olnqj7KT-faUYRFI/edit#gid=0) to track progress.

## Deliverables for Week 2

* Complete 2-3 Beginner tasks and 1-2 Intermediate tasks. Try to achieve a good balance of types of tasks.
* Start thinking about the longer term project that you will be working on for Weeks 3-5.
