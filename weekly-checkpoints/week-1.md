## Week 1

Date: 04/03/2018

Please answer yes/no to the following:

* I feel like I got a good amount of work done this week - yes/no, mostly introductory work, but pretty good since was feeling sick Fri-Tue.
* I know what to do next week - no, but we can discuss this at the meeting!
* There are things which are blocking me from progressing - no, just want to discuss what issue to take on first at the meeting.
* I'm enjoying the program so far - yes!

## Status Update

Please mention the work you did this week. A good status update will mention the things you learned, the things you tried (both what worked and what didn't); and the things you did. As an example:

- [x] [Unit 1 - Basics: Getting comfortable with Git and GitHub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=662333824156547) This unit was pretty straightfoward. 👍
- [x] [Unit 2 - Project: F8 App](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=162143457744403) I followed the instructions but it seems like this unit should be N/A for the program now that Parse is no longer a thing? Can't log in at the Parse Dashboard http://localhost:4040/apps/F8/.
- [x] [Unit 3 - Project: Docusaurus](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ossmentorship/learning_content/?filter=916381401865001) Ran into some weirdness, which I noted [here](https://github.com/amyrlam/docusaurus-starter-kit/commit/ef86fdca64ff6fa6e9f4d67f25e6bdf00c03c2df). It didn't seem to matter too much, since it seemed like it would be a lot easier to test Docusaurus through Prettier or another open source repo with more content in there. 
- Joined the Docusaurus Discord.
- Went through https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues.

## Plan

Summarize what you plan on learning or working on in the next week, and if there are any concerns you have about the plan. As an example:

Hope to discuss these at today's meeting for clarification on how to move forward!

> Want to check that https://github.com/prettier/prettier would be a good candidate for a real Docusaurus site?

> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/227 Always seems good to start with a bug fix to get accustomed to the repo. Maybe this one? Renaming versions doesn't change version in the sidebar.
> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/263 Add tests seems like an important issue to work on.
> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/356 Improve <table> styling.
> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/500 New feature to copy code blocks.  For example, copying code blocks here https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html. 
> https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/234 New feature to add live reload. No idea how to do this yet, but implementing live reload would be cool. Would https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/267 be solved if live reload was added?

> PR open for 23 days? Will I get review from you and/or the Docusaurus team?
https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/495

> Calendar daily time for FB program to make more iterative progress in Week 2.
