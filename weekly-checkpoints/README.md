# Weekly Checkpoints

Weekly checkpoints help you set context for your 1:1 with your mentor so you can have a more constructive discussion. Use this as a starting point to help highlight areas you'd like to discuss; but don't limit the meeting to just these topics. Please have it filled out and ready before your scheduled 1:1.

## Checkpoints
